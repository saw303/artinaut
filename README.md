## What's that name?

The name _Artinaut_ is a combination of the words _Micronaut_ and _Artifacts_.

## Motivation

Due to the fact that common Java based repository managers such as Artifactory are heavy weight applications, require quiet an amount of memory at runtime and have a slow start-up time, they aren't first class citizen in the cloud.

Artinaut aims to solve these major problems and provide a small Java application that is published as a Docker image. The Docker image easily can be deployed using Docker Compose, Kubernetes or other Docker based environments.

## Roadmap

### Release 0.1 ü•ö - Build the basics

- ‚úÖ Support for proxying remote repositories with caching options
- ‚úÖ Support for local repositories
- ‚úÖ Support for virtual repositories (combine a collection of local or remote repositories and expose it as one repository)
- ‚úÖ Support for MariaDB 10.3+
- ‚úÖ Support for Group management
- ‚úÖ Support for User management

### Release 0.2 üê£ - Do first steps

- ‚è≥ Upload artifacts to local repositories

## Example üê≥ Composition 

The following `docker-compose.yml` will help you to setup Artinaut as a Docker Composition.

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  database:
    image: mariadb:10.9.4-jammy
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_secret
      MYSQL_DATABASE: artinaut
      MYSQL_USER: artinaut
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
      TZ: "Europe/Zurich"
      MARIADB_AUTO_UPGRADE: "true"
      LANG: "C.UTF-8"
      LC_ALL: "C.UTF-8"
    volumes:
      - ./dockervolumes/artinaut-db:/var/lib/mysql
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3306:3306"
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "1.0"
          memory: 200M

  artinaut:
    image: ghcr.io/saw303/artinaut/artinaut:0.1.8
    environment:
      DB_HOST: database
      DB_NAME: artinaut
      DB_USER: artinaut
      DB_PWD: secret
      ARTINAUT_FILESTORE: /home/app/filestore
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
    restart: on-failure
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "3.0"
          memory: 200M
```

Run `docker compose up -d` to start Artinaut. Afterwards the application is running on `localhost:8080` and has the following preconfigured remote repositories available:

- Maven Central ‚û°Ô∏è https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2
- Gradle Plugins ‚û°Ô∏è https://plugins.gradle.org/m2

## Admin password

When Artinaut starts the first time, it creates an initial user called `admin`. The password of this user can be found in the logs. Run `docker compose logs -f artinaut` and you will find the password.

```
20:47:23.362 [main] INFO  i.w.a.users.DefaultUserService - Generated password for user ¬´admin¬ª is ¬´9434d630-c762-4737-9514-c8ad9b2f0986¬ª
```

Make sure you store the password in a password manager. The password is only shown at the first start. Passwords are stored as a encoded hash in the database and there is no chance to reverse engineer it once it has been encoded.
