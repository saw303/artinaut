# Artinaut

Artinaut is a tiny and fast Maven repository manager based on the popular Micronaut framework. It allows you to define local, remote and virtual repositories and can act as an internal Maven repository proxy within your organisation.

## Motivation

Due to the fact that common repository managers such as Artifactory are heavy weight applications and require quiet an amount of memory and have a slow start-up time, they aren't first class citizen in the cloud.

## Roadmap

### Release 0.1

- Define remote repositories with caching options (proxy mechanism)
- Define local repositories
- Define virtual repositories
